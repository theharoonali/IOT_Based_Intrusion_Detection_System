# Iot_based_Intrusion_detection_system

In this Project, we propose an IoT-based IDS that utilizes supervised data and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Our system takes data packets captured from Wireshark, containing network traffic data, and predicts whether the traffic is normal or abnormal. It can also classify the type of attack, such as Mirai, DDoS, or other attacks.
